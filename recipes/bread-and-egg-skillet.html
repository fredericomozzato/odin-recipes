        <li>4 slices of baguette (around 2.g cm thick each)</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 green bell peppers</li>
        <li>4 tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 table spoon of sweet smoked paprika (1.15 g)</li>
        <li>1/2 table spoon of dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of vegetable broth</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>a pinch of sea salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>white sugar</li>
        <li>fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        Instructions:
        <li>Cut each slice of baguette into 6 evenly sized cubes. Roughly chop the onion, thinly slice the garlic, cut the bell peppers into small bite-sized pieces and finely grate the tomatoes</li>
        <li>Heat a large fry pan with a medium heat and the olive oil for a couple of minutes</li>
        <li>Add the cubes of bread to the pan, mix continuously. After 3 or 4 minutes, when they're golden fried, remove them from the pan and set them aside</li>
        <li>With the same pan and the same heat add in the onion, bell pepper and garlic. Mix with the olive oil for about 5 minutes. When the vegetables are lightly sauteed add in the paprika and thyme, quickly mix it together, then add the grated tomatoes and season it with sea salt, black pepper and a little bit of white sugar. Mix it together and let it simmer</li>
        <li>Once the grated tomato has slightly thickened up (around 5 minutes of simmering) add in the pieces of fried bread back into the pan, along with the vegetable broth. Give it a mix and bring it to a boil. Then add in the eggs, making sure to evenly spread them around. Then place  lid on the pan and lower to a low-medium heat. Cook until the eggs are just cooked through (between 3 to 5 minutes)</li>
        <li>Serve it directly out of the pan, sprinkled with finelly chopped parsley</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>

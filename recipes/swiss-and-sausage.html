    <p>
        For this sandwich you'll use a mild ground sausage. In my recipe I use a specific variety called <a href="https://www.brasilagosto.org/en/blumenau-sausage/">Blumenau Sausage</a>, that is used as a spread on bread.
        The bread we use is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciabatta">ciabatta</a>, and the cheese is Gruyère.
    </p>
    <ul>
        Ingredients
        <li>Ciabatta</li>
        <li>Mild ground sausage</li>
        <li>Sliced Gruyère cheese</li>
        <li>Red onion</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        Instructions
        <li>Slice the ciabatta in half and put a little bit of olive oil in it. Toast the bread in a pan with low heat until golden</li>
        <li>Get some of the sausage and spread it in a plate, mold it in the form of the bread, pressing gently to form a sort of sausage patty</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the patty from the plate with the help of a spatula and place it in the pan. If you use a non adherent there's no need for any oil</li>
        <li>Place a slice of Gruyère cheese on top of the sausage, place a lid on top of it and wait for the cheese to melt</li>
        <li>Spread a little bit of mustard on the ciabatta, place the sliced onion on the bottom slice</li>
        <li>When the cheese melts carefully remove the sausage from the pan and place it on the bread</li>
        <li>You can also add some mayo on the upper slice of bread, then close the sandwich and enjoy it!</li>
    </ol>

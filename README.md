Recipes - The Odin Project

This is my first website and it'll be developed as I progress through the course. 

The idea is to have a complete website of recipies formated as a restaurant menu with pictures, appropriate design and some elements of humour.

At the present state I'm only through the first part of the HTML trainning, but as I gain knowledge in CSS and Javascript this project will be updated to reflect my new habilities.

By the end of this course I intend to have a fully functional responsive website, that can be viewed in a large screen as well as in mobile.

As of now the recipes are very generic but I intend to make it a sandwich recipes website with my own creations (as I'm a sandwich master myself), using my own photos and sandwich names!

If you're reading this and have some tips or comments feel free to contact me!
